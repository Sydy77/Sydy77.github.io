    <h1>So...</h1>
    <p>I know u wanted something big</p>
    <p>But I also know you love nerdy stuff too</p>
    <p>So please let me flatter you</p>
    <p>With one of these poems or two</p>
    <p>This is by far the most cringe thing i've done</p>
    <p>But I thought it would do</p>
    <p>---<p>
    <p>I want you to know</p>
    <p>That every one of my solutions is dedicated to you</p>
    <p>and that all my derivatives make me think of you too</p>
    <p>When we lie together in bed, finding integrals by parts</p>
    <p>I can't help myself but to think 'where's the maximum of her smarts'</p>
    <p>You're as beautiful as the heavens</p>
    <p>And as sweet as C12-H22-O11</p>
    <p>So will you declare in the land of the free</p>
    <p>If you will go to prom with me?</p>
    <p>----</p> 
    <b>Love u</b>
