    <h1>So...</h1>
    <h1>I know u wanted something big</h1>
    <h1>But I also know you love nerdy stuff too</h1>
    <h1>So please let me flatter you</h1>
    <h1>With one of these poems or two</h1>
    <h1>This is by far the most cringe thing i've done</h1>
    <h1>But I thought it would do</h1>
    <h1>---<h1>
    <h1>I want you to know</h1>
    <h1>That every one of my solutions is dedicated to you</h1>
    <h1>and that all my derivatives make me think of you too</h1>
    <h1>When we lie together in bed, finding integrals by parts</h1>
    <h1>I can't help myself but to think 'where's the maximum of her smarts'</h1>
    <h1>You're as beautiful as the heavens</h1>
    <h1>And as sweet as C12-H22-O11</h1>
    <h1>So will you declare in the land of the free</h1>
    <h1>If you will go to prom with me?</h1>
    <h1>----</h1> 
    <b>Love u</b>
